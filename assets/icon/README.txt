# Pumpkin App Icons

## Next Steps:

1. The HTML file 'create_basic_icons.html' should have opened in your browser
2. Click "Generate Icons" to create app_icon.png and app_icon_foreground.png
3. Save both files to this 'assets/icon/' directory
4. Run: flutter pub get
5. Run: dart run flutter_launcher_icons
6. Run: flutter clean && flutter run

## Manual Alternative:

If the HTML generator doesn't work, create any 1024x1024 PNG image and name it:
- app_icon.png (with background)  
- app_icon_foreground.png (transparent background)

The flutter_launcher_icons package will handle the rest!
