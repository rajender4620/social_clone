# Firebase Setup Instructions

## Fixed Issues âœ…

### 1. TabController Error - FIXED
- Updated ProfileView to use StatefulWidget with TabController
- Added proper lifecycle management for TabController

### 2. Firestore Index Error - FIXED
- Created firestore.indexes.json with required composite indexes
- Modified user posts query to work without requiring immediate index deployment
- Added Firebase configuration files

## Firebase Configuration Files Created

- `firebase.json` - Main Firebase configuration
- `firestore.rules` - Security rules for Firestore
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Database indexes configuration

## Deploy Firebase Configuration (Optional)

To deploy the Firestore indexes and rules to your Firebase project:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project (if not done)
firebase init

# Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore
```

## Current Query Approach

The profile system now uses a **hybrid approach**:
- Queries posts by `authorId` only (no composite index needed)
- Sorts results in memory by `createdAt` 
- Works immediately without waiting for index deployment
- Can be optimized later with proper indexes

## What's Fixed

âœ… **Profile Page Navigation** - No more TabController errors
âœ… **User Posts Loading** - Works without Firestore index errors  
âœ… **Profile System** - Fully functional and ready to use
âœ… **Firebase Configuration** - Proper rules and indexes defined

## Next Steps

The profile system is now **fully working**! You can:
1. Navigate to any user profile via `/profile/{userId}`
2. View user posts in a grid layout
3. See profile information and stats
4. Use the tab system (posts/bookmarks)

The app should now run without the previous errors! ðŸŽ‰
